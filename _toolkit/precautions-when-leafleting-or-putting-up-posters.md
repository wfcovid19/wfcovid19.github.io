title: Leafleting and Postering Protocol
guide: "Firstly, please refer to this excellent [guide](https://queercare.network/our-work/resources/covid-19/policy-for-doing-support-work-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/)
  for conducting support work in the COVID-19 pandemic and [overview](https://queercare.network/our-work/resources/covid-19/principles-and-assumptions-for-doing-support-work-in-the-covid-19-pandemic/)
  of the assumptions and guidance that this guide was written from.\n\n## Safety precautions
  for printing\n\nYou should not do this if you are ill at all. Wash your hands thoroughly
  before taking leaflets out of the printer and put the leaflets directly into a ziploc
  bag (in small piles up to about 40) with minimal handling.\n\n## Distributing Leaflets\n\n###
  Door-to-door\n\nIt is important to follow safety guidelines when distributing leaflets
  to ensure that as far as possible we are not exposing people to the virus and putting
  anyone at more harm. Here are some guidelines that everyone distributing leaflets
  should follow. You should not do this if you are ill at all.\n\n* Leaflets should
  be in smaller piles within ziploc bags\n* Make sure to wash your hands well before
  starting leafleting and use hand sanitizer if you are able to at regular intervals.\n*
  Only one person should handle leaflets from each ziplocked pack, putting them directly
  from the bag through the door for each house and minimising contact as far as possible\n*
  Make sure to wash your hands after you are finished too\n\n## Other\n\nThere are
  lots of public places where you can also place piles of leaflets for people. Some
  examples:\n\n* Libraries, community centres and religious buildings\n* Cafes\n*
  Shop counters (ask!)\n* \n\n## Distributing Posters\n\nPosters should be put up
  around the local area. Some ideas of places to put them are:\n\n* Shop and cafe
  windows and noticeboards (ask for permission!)\n* Community noticeboards (try religious
  centres, libraries, community centres, blocks of flats)"
