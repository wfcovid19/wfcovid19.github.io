Waltham Forest Mutual Aid is a grassroots community group volunteering support for our neighbours during the COVID-19 outbreak.

We are a network of many ward-level groups, each of which is in turn a network of street-level groups, set up to support their immediate neighbours.

Read our <a href="/toolkit">Toolkit</a> for advice on running a ward or street-level branch.

Use our <a href="/signposting">Signposting guide</a> to find local organisations that can support you with a variety of issues.
