## Chingford Bells and Highams Park Sparkle Christmas Present fundraiser

### Help us give the gift of Christmas

These unprecedented times have yielded unprecedented displays of care and concern from our community – a commitment to ensuring that no one in Highams Park and Chingford was without help, support and food.

Building on all we have achieved together, we’re asking our amazing community to come together once again to support the Chingford Bells and Highams Sparkle Christmas present fundraiser.

We would like to ensure that vulnerable children in our community are assured of what every single child deserves on Christmas morning: a present, just for them.

We’re aiming to raise £5000 in order to give 250 children a £20 gift voucher to spend in local shops. Vouchers will be redeemable in participating shops in Chingford and Highams Park, in order to support our businesses and local economy at this challenging time.

Chingford and Highams Park Mutual Aid are running this fundraiser in association with Highams Park Food Hub, Peabody’s Pantry and Friday Hill Food rescue Hub. Referrals for vouchers will be made privately by food banks, social workers and teachers.

Support your local businesses and be secret Santa to a child in need this Christmas.
