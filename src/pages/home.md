## What are we offering? 

Each ward in the borough has set up its own local mutual aid group. Each group is different, but the kinds of help on offer are:

 * doing shopping
 * picking up prescriptions
 * running errands
 * a friendly chat and advice
 * free meals, cooked in community kitchens across the borough

If your local group can't help you directly, they may be able to put you in touch with someone who can.

## What is mutual aid?

Mutual aid isn’t charity. It’s our community working together to care for one another, and especially for those of us most likely to be hit hardest in times of crisis and who may be unable to find help elsewhere. 

By connecting people, sharing resources and responding to the needs of the community, we hope to become stronger, more resilient and better equipped for the future.
