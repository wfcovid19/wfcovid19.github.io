Waltham Forest Mutual Aid is a network of local people who have come together to support each other during the Covid-19 Pandemic. 
There are 20 Ward Mutual Aid Groups, search for your local group, or see details of all 20, [here](/).

### How did Waltham Forest Mutual Aid Form?
Local people came together at the beginning of the lockdown in March 2020 to support each other and their neighbours during the pandemic. We found that those who were shielding and isolated were the most affected and needed more support e.g food shopping, access to food banks, hot meals.

### What does ‘mutual aid’ mean?
Mutual aid is where a group of people organise to meet their own needs, outside of the formal frameworks of charities, NGOs and government. All individuals are equally powerful and there are no ‘leaders’ or unelected ‘steering committees’ in mutual aid projects; there is only a group of people who work together as equals. 
Mutual aid isn’t about “saving” anyone; it’s about people coming together, in a spirit of solidarity, to support and look out for one another.

### What is a mutual aid group?
A mutual aid group is a volunteer led initiative where groups of people in a particular area join together to support one another, meeting vital community and individual needs without the help of official bodies. They do so in a way that prioritises those who are most vulnerable or unable to access help.

### Our area isn’t covered by a Mutual Aid Road group. Who do I need to speak to before setting up a local road group?
No one! Anyone can set up a mutual aid group and no one needs permission. You may want to join the [Facebook](https://facebook.com/groups/wfcoronavirus) to meet others in similar groups to share knowledge with.

It's also worth taking the time to talk to existing community projects and support services in your area to see if you can support the work they are already doing.
